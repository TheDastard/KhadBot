# KhadBot plan changes

Contract changes waiting to be applied to the design plans: the "KhadBot Encounter Review Refactor" plan
(https://claude.ai/artifact/Q45H17JuH5EXK8oz17CzQE) and the web portal plan
(https://claude.ai/artifact/RWKPP7XyMXb6Gb2iFGhMqD). Branches don't edit the plan artifacts themselves; they
record their changes here, and a closing plan-sync pass applies every entry to the artifacts and empties this
file.

A contract change is anything the plans specify: models, file formats, evidence refs, failure rules, digest
fields, the API surface.

How to add an entry:

- Add a `##` heading named after your branch (for example `## encounter/ingest-metadata`) and put all of that
  branch's changes under it.
- For each change, name the plan and section it changes, then write the replacement text for that section, not
  just a description of the change.
- Only add to this file. Never rewrite or reorder another branch's heading. On a merge conflict, keep both sides.

## repo/ci

Work plan (Polish and Digest Dashboard), decision R15, rule P2, the E0 card's `mise.toml`, and every task card
that names a mise task: tasks that are variants of one group use a `group:` prefix. Replace the names as follows.

| Plan text | Task as built |
|---|---|
| `mise run test-unit` / `test-integ` / `test-eval` | `mise run test:unit` / `test:integ` / `test:eval` |
| `mise run gen-contracts` | `mise run gen:contracts` |
| `mise run fixture-data` | `mise run gen:fixture-data` |
| `mise run distclean` | `mise run clean:all` |
| (none) | `mise run install:runtime`, `mise run install:cli`; bare `install` stays the full dev install |

New tasks follow the same rule: D2's web tasks become `gen:types` (not `gen-types`), and `dev-web` and `e2e` take a
group prefix where they have siblings (for example `web:dev`, `test:e2e`).

## encounter/ingest-metadata

### Refactor plan 6.1 (Ingest models)

Add a bullet:

- **Death rows** from WCL carry `abilityGameID: 0` and `sourceID: -1`, with the killing blow in
  `killingAbilityGameID` and the killer in `killerID`. Normalize sets `ability_id` from `killingAbilityGameID` when
  `abilityGameID` is 0 or missing, and `source_id` from `killerID` when `sourceID` is -1, for Deaths `death` rows.
  The event schema does not change. Death records treat a death ability of 0 as unknown, so events normalized
  before this rule fall back to the last hit.
